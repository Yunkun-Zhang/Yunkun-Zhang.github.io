#### [Text-Guided Foundation Model Adaptation for Pathological Image Classificaton](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.14901)

**Abstract:** The recent surge of foundation models in computer vision and natural language processing opens up perspectives in utilizing multi-modal clinical data to train large models with strong generalizability. Yet pathological image datasets often lack biomedical text annotation and enrichment. Guiding data-efficient image diagnosis from the use of biomedical text knowledge becomes a substantial interest. In this paper, we propose to Connect Image and Text Embeddings (CITE) to enhance pathological image classification. CITE injects text insights gained from language models pre-trained with a broad range of biomedical texts, leading to adapt foundation models towards pathological image understanding. Through extensive experiments on the PatchGastric stomach tumor pathological image dataset, we demonstrate that CITE achieves leading performance compared with various baselines especially when training data is scarce. CITE offers insights into leveraging in-domain text knowledge to reinforce data-efficient pathological image classification. Code is available at https://github.com/Yunkun-Zhang/CITE.

#### [Data-Centric Foundation Models in Computational Healthcare: A Survey](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.02458)

**Abstract:** The advent of foundation models (FMs) as an emerging suite of AI techniques has struck a wave of opportunities in computational healthcare. The interactive nature of these models, guided by pre-training data and human instructions, has ignited a data-centric AI paradigm that emphasizes better data characterization, quality, and scale. In healthcare AI, obtaining and processing high-quality clinical data records has been a longstanding challenge, ranging from data quantity, annotation, patient privacy, and ethics. In this survey, we investigate a wide range of data-centric approaches in the FM era (from model pre-training to inference) towards improving the healthcare workflow. We discuss key perspectives in AI security, assessment, and alignment with human values. Finally, we offer a promising outlook of FM-based analytics to enhance the performance of patient outcome and clinical workflow in the evolving landscape of healthcare and medicine. We provide an up-to-date list of healthcare-related foundation models and datasets at https://github.com/Yunkun-Zhang/Data-Centric-FM-Healthcare.
